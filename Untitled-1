                    <p class="section-content"> Pomogranate is a mobile app that helps individuals use the Pomodoro method to manage their time. The Pomodoro method is a time management tool in which you focus for 25 minutes, and reward yourself with a 5 minute break. I decided to design this app after I had trouble re-inspring myself to do another 'Pomodoro' after I completed one. After doing some research, it became obvious that this was a problem a lot of people faced.  </p>

                        <p class="section-content"> My main source of research was the flaws of Pomodoro technique. I found the following flaws through research and a survey I put out to a demographic of students and industry professionals.  </p>

                        <p class="section-content">My first idea for this was to create a Google Chrome extension. I created some wireframes around a desktop version of this app. However, going back to the personas I was designing for and the need for flexibility, I didn't think that a chrome extention was adequate enough. Why would I want users to be attached to a desktop when they can have an experience on their smartphone?   </p>
                        <p class="section-content"> My next idea was around users inputting all of their to-dos for the day and then select them as they want to complete them. The wireframes below display a user's 'To-Dos' and their 'Dids'. I wanted a way for users to indicate when they completed a task, so that they can become motivated by all they have done. </p>

The metrics I was testing were: Time (how long does it take to get into the next pomodoro), and qualitative feedback (how do you feel?)  </p>

                     <p class="section-content">   However, solution 3 yielded in the smallest time between completing the short break and going onto the next Pomodoro, averaging about 8 seconds.

                       <p class="section-content"> he goal of a pomodoro 'short break' is to relax, but also to remotivate the user to step back into their next Pomodoro. I decided to differentiate the two timers through colour.  </p>
