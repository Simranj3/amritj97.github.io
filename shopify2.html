                    <p class="section-content"> Dashboards should be scannable and easy to understand. A common complaint with the current dashboard is that it is high in information density and there is no way to customize it.

                        <p class="section-content">   In January 2017 Shopify saw an increase in support desk ticketes relating to the dashboard. I dug deeper into the problem by reading through the support desk tickets and doing some user interviews, mainly watching as users approached the dashboard section of Shopify. </p>
                       
                    <p class="section-content"> We saw two major problems with the dashboard and how information is laid out: </p>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Where information is placed doesn't make sense to merchants. They don't understand how to get from the dashboard to reports. </li>   
                        <li> The data visualization types are dated, merchants are not able to gain useful information from the way the dashboard is currently laid out</li>  
                        <li> Dashboard serve different functions for different types of businesses and as business maturity grows. </li> 
                    </ul>
                       
                    <p class="section-content"> I mapped out the problems and common themes we saw with specific personal types: </p>

                        <p class="section-content">   In order to determine what metrics to surface on the dashboard, I collaborated with our data engineering team to sync up on what metrics were on their roadmap. I mapped out the data points that we could surface to our merchants, using two different schemas.   </p>
                        
                        <p class="section-content"> The first schema maps out information depending on business vertical. In this case, I bolded metrics that users mentioned were particularily valuable. </p>

                        <p class="section-content"> <b> Pros: </b>Tells a more accurate story of the data (merchants usually make business decisions depending on verticals), easy to share with specific members of the business, scales for more types of businesses </p>
                        <p class="section-content"> <b> Cons: </b>  Some metrics will not be populated (small businesses might not have sales data until the first month)</p>
                        
                         <p class="section-content"> For the second schema, I explored sectioning off data by business type. Shopify has 3 main business types that need vastly different metrics to make business decisions. For example, Dropshipping businesses, which account for 15% of Shopify businesses, mostly care about marketing data since they don't have any stock.  </p>

                        <p class="section-content"> <b> Pros: </b>  Would be catered to business type, potentially more useful</b></p>
                        <p class="section-content"> <b> Cons: </b>  Businesses change all the time (a dropshipping business might not always be dropshipping) </p>
                        
                        <p class="section-content"> The verdict was to section information by business vertical. This gives businesses a more accurate story of their data. </p>
